# Geocoded Homeowners Guide
  This project is my attempt to connect python with GIS; the goal of the project is to be able to input a name or field, and the code is intended to go through a database and export the relevant information so that it can easily be mapped on ArcMap or be shared. A family looking for a house to buy wants to find the best neighborhood to buy in. Running off attributes fields such as crime rates, schools, and distance to downtown. You want to be able to search for an attribute and have a program spit out the relevant data in shapefile (or database if shapefile isn't possible) format. This project DOES require ArcGIS to run.
