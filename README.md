# GIS python name finder
  This project is an attempt to connect python with GIS; the goal of the project is to be able to input a name or field for the code to go through a database and export relevant information so that it can easily be mapped on ArcMap or be shared. The buyer wants to be able to search for an attribute and have a program spit out the relevant data in shapefile (or database if shapefile isn't possible) format. The attribute fields include crime rates, schools, and distance to downtown. This project DOES require ArcGIS to run.
